## File description

`run_analysis.R` contains the code to perform the step-by-step cleanning of the data described [here](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-014/human_grading/view/courses/973501/assessments/3/submissions). 

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`tidy_data.txt` is the resulting tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
